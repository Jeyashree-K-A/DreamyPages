Dreamy Pages

Hi, I'm Jeyashree!  
I'm a 2nd-year Computer Science student with a passion for building creative websites. I enjoy working on themes that reflect culture, literature, and aesthetics. I'm currently learning JavaScript and exploring web development to create even more amazing projects!

ðŸŒŸ Welcome to Dreamy Pages, my cozy and magical little project where books truly come alive. This website is a reflection of my love for reading and my journey into the world of web development. Iâ€™ve tried to make it feel like the perfect spot for book loversâ€”warm, dreamy, and inviting. Whether you're here to admire, get inspired, or just enjoy the vibe, I hope you feel at home. Creating this has been such a fun adventure, and I canâ€™t wait to share it with you. Happy exploring.

This project was built using HTML and CSS.
