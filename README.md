Dreamy Pages

Hi there! ðŸŒŸ Welcome to Dreamy Pages, my cozy and magical little project where books truly come alive. This website is a reflection of my love for reading and my journey into the world of web development. Iâ€™ve tried to make it feel like the perfect spot for book loversâ€”warm, dreamy, and inviting. Whether you're here to admire, get inspired, or just enjoy the vibe, I hope you feel at home. Creating this has been such a fun adventure, and I canâ€™t wait to share it with you. Happy exploring.

This project was built using HTML and CSS.
